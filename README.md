# Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive-Portfolio is a 3-page responsive website which features the Bootstrap CSS Framework. 

## Description 
The site predominantly utilizes Bootstrap's components and grid system, but is accompanied by CSS and Font Awesome stylesheets for additional customization. The site contains the following pages:
    1. About Me
        - Contains brief bio and image
    2. Portfolio
        - Contains a collection of images with functioning external links taking the user to social profiles
    2. Contact
        - Contains a contact form (submit button does not function)

There are functioning links located in the navigation bar as well as the portfolio page. The links in the navigation bar take you to the various pages of the website, whereas the links embedded in the images on the portfolio page take the user to various external social media sites / profiles. 

The HTML Body is dissected into three sections for each page:
    1. Header
    2. Main
    3. Footer
Comments describing the function and use of content in each section is supplied in all three HTML files.

Media Queries are applied to the CSS page to ensure the desired, user-friendly aesthetic at various screen widths, including:
    1. 980px
    2. 768px
    3. 640px

Finally, a variety of comments are supplied in the CSS file to designate which elements have been styled, and specifically, which page and section to refer to.
